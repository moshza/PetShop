# PetShop
In this project I used Sql Db for storing pet's data and Asp.NET Core application.
The project contains the following folders: Controllers,Views,Models,Repositories,wwwroot(for static local files).
And also DbContext file as an outcome of migration that connects the DB to the application. 

Languages: C#,HTML
